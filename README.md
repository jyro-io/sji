## Socrates for Julia

### Overview

Julia is a high-performance language for technical computing,
and pairs well with the functionality Socrates offers.

This package provides an interface where those versed in Julia
can hit the ground running. It defines functions that abstract 
many simpler operations into a more human-friendly workflow.

#### Installation

```bash
pkg> add git@github.com:jyro-io/sji.git
```

#### Usage

See `test/runtests.jl` for example usage.

We're working on a full application that uses this package to
showcase the capabilities of using this package to interface
with our systems. When that's finished, we'll link it here.
